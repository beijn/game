# Game thats AwesoME


## Plan 

- CI/CD compile + deploy to gh-pages (else I would need to add ./gh-pages/target/* to the main branch...)

- bevy to web (ecs)

- bevy draw something on the web

- c++ interop

- Visor interop

- draw b/w visibility polygon (static)


### (long term)

- make c++ part portable


### (done)

- gh-pages wasm minimal demo
- wasm compilation and interop
- bevy skeleton (fast compile)
